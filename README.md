# Khan Academy SQL Practice Project 

Welcome to my SQL practice repository! This collection contains SQL excercises and projects that I completed while learning SQL through many different online resources. I recreated these projects here to continue practicing, track my progress and build a portfolio of my SQL skills.
This repository includes: 
- SQL quieries covering SELECT statements, JOINs, GROUP BY and subqueries
- Practice files organized by topic
- Notes and reflections on what I've learned
## Project Overview 
- This specific project simulates a small retail inventory system with three product categories:
- ** Inventory** : Shirts and tops with attributes like color, size, price and availability.
- ** Jeans** : Various styles of jeans with color, fit, and price.
- ** Jewlery** : Accessories with Material, type and price.
 
  - Each category is stored in its own table and a final query combines all products into a unified list sorted by price.
 
  - ## Skills Practiced
  - 'Create Table' and 'Insert INTO'
  - Data types: 'INTEGER', ' TEXT', 'REAl'
  - 'UNION ALL' to combine datasets
  - 'ORDER BY' for sorting results
  - Aliasing columns with 'AS'
